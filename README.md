# virtualbox-CLI

This simple tool allows us to interact with VirtualBox and:

- Open an existing VM.
- Close an open VM.
- Create a VM (in progress)
- Delete a VM (in progress)

To run the project:

1. pip install virtualbox
2. type python vbox-cli.py on you terminal and the CLI will guide you!

Cheers!

Notes:
I'm beggining to work with python.
Right now I'm studying about requirements.txt to avoid step one and install required dependencies.
